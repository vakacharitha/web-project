# <p align="center"> Bapatla Engineering College Website</p>

The vision is to build college website by the students for the students. This has all of the required documentation to help assist in modifiying or incoporating features into the website in future. 

The tech stack we have decided to use are the following:

### Front-end technologies:
- React 18
- React Router 6.5

### Back-end technologies:
- Python

### Why did we choose these technologies ? 

#### React:

We chose React becuase it is the best, although the exisitng website has been designed using React, we are doing a complete design overhaul and since this will be built with documentation, it should be relatively easier to modify and change.

#### React:

The best router that is available right now.


### Understanding the code:

Front-end: 

You need to understand [React 18](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [React Router 6.5](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to work on the fron-end code base.

First you need to understand the Folder strcuture of the project. Folder structure might seem trivial but you need to stay organized to make sure others can work on it as time goes on and it can be further expanded. Any chagnes to the folder structured in terms of better organization are welcomed to make it better than the exisitng one.

The ` src ` folder consists of all the code that is responsible for the website. It consists of subfolders





##### Alternatives for React:
We could have gone with NextJS but given that we have limited time and also the team developing this website for the first time is quite in-expereinced with React, to use a framrwork(NextJS) would not exactly be fruitful but in the future this option can be explored along with TS instead of JS.

#### Alternatives for React Router:
TanStack Router, This is a router that is based on TS and is better than React Router in terms of DX but as of now it is still in Beta so this can be used in the future.
